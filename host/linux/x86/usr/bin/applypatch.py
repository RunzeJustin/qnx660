where:
       -b
       Do NOT provide a backup. This means you will not be able to roll 
       back this patch or any patches applied after this. This is not 
       recommended for general use.
       
       -c 
       Extract patch contents only. No metadata will be recorded nor 
       will any backup file be generated. This is useful when pulling out 
       individual files for testing but is not recommended for general use.  
       
       -d <path>
       Specify destination path. This path will be the root directory used
       for extracting the patch contents as well as for storing the patch 
       metadata. The default will be the currently active QNX SDP Installation.
        
      -F
      Turn off prompting by forcing a 'yes' answer to all queries.
      Normally newer files will not be overwritten by older files from the 
      patch. This option disables that check. This means locally updated files
      may be SILENTLY REPLACED by an older version from the patch. 
      
      -h -?
      This help.
      
      -H
      Install all host files. Normally only the files suitable for the running
      platform are installed. In the case of a server or if the patch is to 
      be applied by hand later on other platforms this option will install
      all host specific files. 
       
      -l
      List patches ordered by newest to oldest (based on installation time)
      
      -v 
      Verbose. Display some information on progress and activities.
      
      -U <num>
      Uninstall patch number <num>. Due to the nature of the patching process
      any patch which was installed after patch <num> will be uninstalled as
      well. In effect you will roll back to the state the system was in just
      before patch <num> _and all subsequent patches_ were applied.
